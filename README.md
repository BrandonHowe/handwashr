# handwashr

Hi, welcome to the Handwashr repo.

This project wasn't really more than me trying to learn Ionic. The feature is nice, and it certainly is useful, but it wasn't the original goal. That being said, still wash your hands well, it's important!

Sidenote about Ionic: it's good, but not for me. Maybe it's because I was using Angular as a Vue dev (although my roots were in angular) but it just felt a bit... limited. Whatever, app development isn't my focus anyways.
